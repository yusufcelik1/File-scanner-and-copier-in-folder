# File-scanner-and-copier-in-folder
Scenario :

You work in a company and there is a folder called Test created for you. The pdf files in this folder belong to you. You need to copy these pdf files to your desktop, but there is a problem. Test files are in the project folders and there are thousands of project files. You need to write a program that will copy the pdf files in each test file.

Additional Improvements Made:

- Scanning can be done by selecting the file type.
- Optionally, only the test folder or all folders can be scanned.
-The file can be copied one by one or all at once.
